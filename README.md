# Espresso

This is a personal project where I am creating an interpreted programming language. The language uses custom syntax and is written in Python. This is my first time attempting something like this so Python was the backend of choice primarily to avoid haveing to worru about memory and optimization until a future project. 

As of now, the language has a terminal style interface that allows the user to run basic math expressions using the +,-,/,*,^,//,% and == operators along with logical operators along with declaring variables of a numeric type using a syntax similar to Python. The user can also run a set of built in functions.


This README will be updated periodically as more features and functionality are added to the program
